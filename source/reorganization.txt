Functions in main:

showing numbers on screen:
    >> display_game_info(uint16_t number)
        >>Shows how many decks have been played and eventually will show the count
        >> Associated functions:    DrawNumberBkg
    
    >> DrawNumberBkg(uint8_t x,uint8_t y, uint16_t number,uint8_t digits)
        >>Writes a number to the background layer given its length, value, and coordinates

    >> show_score(hand *self)
        >> Display's the score of a given hand
        >> associated functions:    DrawNumberBkg
    
    >> DrawNumber(uint8_t x,uint8_t y, uint16_t number,uint8_t digits)
        >> Writes numbers to the window
        >> exactly the same as DrawNumberBKG
            except for the: set_win_tile_xy and set_bkg_tile_xy

the following 3 should be placed in a common.c file
    >> performantdelay(uint8_t numloops)
        >> provides a non-CPU intensive delay
    >> fadein()
    >> fadeout()

game specific functions:
    >> void dealer_draws(deck *d, hand *dlr_h, uint8_t * sprite_count)
        >> fulfills the action of the dealer drawing untill they get 17
        >> associated functions : from card_structures: recieve_card

    >> UBYTE outcome(UBYTE p_score, UBYTE p_flags, UBYTE d_score, UBYTE d_flags)
        >> determines a game's outcome given the scores and flags
    
    >> void settle_score(player *dlr, player *p)
        >> associated functions : outcome
